# This file should contain only "defaults" definitions.
# Valid params in defaults definitions are the same as on job definitions:
#  http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/definition.html#job
# A "defaults" definition with name "global" will be implicitly applied to all jobs
# that do not explicitly use another set of named defaults.
